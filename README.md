# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises and coding tasks from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow".

## About the Book

"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" is a comprehensive guide for beginners looking to understand the core concepts of machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. The book provides practical examples and hands-on exercises to help grasp the theories and methods of machine learning.

## Note

Due to the limitations of my current device, some of the larger exercises could not be completed and are therefore missing from this repository. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized chapter-wise, each containing the corresponding coding exercises and tasks from the book.

- Chapter 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
- Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project
- Chapter 3: Classification

## Running the Code

All code is written in Python and can be run using Jupyter notebooks. Make sure to install the necessary libraries mentioned in the book.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my personal use, suggestions and improvements are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
